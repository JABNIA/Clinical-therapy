       <p>
          With over 12 years of experience in mental health care, I am dedicated
          to helping clients achieve emotional balance and personal fulfillment.
          I hold a PhD in Clinical Psychology from Stanford University and
          specialize in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), trauma therapy, and
          mindfulness-based approaches. My approach is collaborative,
          compassionate, and tailored to your unique needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my practice, I am passionate about mental health advocacy,
          leading community workshops, and conducting research on resilience and
          well-being. I believe healing begins with trust, and Iâ€™m committed to
          walking alongside you on your journey to wellness.
